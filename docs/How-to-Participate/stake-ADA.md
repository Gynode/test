# Stake ADA

The **SECOND STEP** to your success is to stake some ADA to the HARVEST stake pool.  This stake pool is one of the important parts of this project so you would be promoting it if you staked some ADA to the pool although it is not compulsory to do so.

**Not participating** in the stake pool will not affect your participation in the project as a whole in any way but remember, the more ADA staked to a stake pool the bigger are its chances of producing blocks and getting ADA rewards.

**Your contribution to the HARVEST stake pool will be greatly appreciated.**
